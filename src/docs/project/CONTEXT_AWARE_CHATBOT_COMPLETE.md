## 💬 **Example Interactions:**

### **Context-Aware Welcome:**
```
🤖: "👋 Hi! I can see you're reading **What is Physical AI?** 
     I'm here to help you understand embodied intelligence concepts!"
```

### **Personalized Responses:**
```
👤 User: "What is ROS?"

🤖 Context-Aware Response:
     "Since you're new to robotics (from your profile), let me explain ROS 2 
     simply: It's like the 'nervous system' for robots - it helps different 
     parts of your robot talk to each other. In this chapter about Physical AI, 
     ROS 2 is the middleware that connects the robot's 'brain' (AI) to its 
     'body' (sensors and actuators)."
```

### **Chapter-Specific Help:**
```
👤 User: "I don't understand this section"

🤖 Context-Aware Response:
     "I see you're in the 'Sensorimotor Integration' section of Chapter 1-1. 
     This is about how robots combine sensing (input) and movement (output). 
     Think of it like how you automatically reach for a glass - your eyes see it, 
     brain processes location, and hand moves precisely. Would you like me to 
     explain with a robotics example?"
```

## 🚀 **Technical Capabilities**

### **Real-Time Context Detection:**
```javascript
// Automatically detects:
- Current chapter ID from URL
- Page content and headings  
- User scroll position
- Time spent reading
- Section within chapter
```

### **Enhanced AI Integration:**
```python
# Context enhancement includes:
- User background from Better-auth
- Chapter learning objectives
- Related content from vector DB
- Technical term difficulty level
- Previous conversation history
```

### **Smart Suggestions:**
```
Chapter 1-1 Suggestions:
- "What is the difference between traditional AI and Physical AI?"
- "Can you explain embodied intelligence with an example?"
- "How does sensorimotor integration work in robots?"
```
