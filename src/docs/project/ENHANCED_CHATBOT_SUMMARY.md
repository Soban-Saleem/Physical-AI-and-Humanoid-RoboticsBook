## 💬 **Amazing Interactive Examples:**

### **Context-Aware Welcome:**
```
🤖 "👋 Hi! I can see you're reading **'What is Physical AI?'** 
    Since you're new to robotics (from your profile), I'll explain 
    embodied intelligence concepts step-by-step. How can I help?"
```

### **Smart Question Answering:**
```
👤 "What is ROS?"

🤖 "Great question! Since you're in Chapter 1-1 about Physical AI 
    and you're new to robotics, let me explain ROS 2 simply:
    
    Think of ROS 2 as the 'nervous system' for robots. Just like your 
    nervous system connects your brain to your muscles, ROS 2 connects 
    the robot's AI 'brain' to its sensors and actuators.
    
    In the context of Physical AI that you're reading about, ROS 2 is 
    the middleware that makes embodied intelligence possible by letting 
    different robot parts communicate.
    
    Would you like me to show you a simple code example, or explain 
    how this relates to the sensorimotor integration you're learning about?"
```

### **Chapter-Specific Suggestions:**
```
💡 Suggested Questions for Chapter 1-1:
- "What is the difference between traditional AI and Physical AI?"
- "Can you explain embodied intelligence with an example?"
- "How does sensorimotor integration work in robots?"
- "What are some real-world applications of Physical AI?"
```

## 🚀 **Technical Implementation Highlights:**

### **Real-Time Context Detection:**
```javascript
// Automatically detects and sends:
{
  current_chapter: "1-1",
  page_content: "Live webpage content...",
  user_background: {
    software: "beginner",
    hardware: "none",
    personalization_level: "complete_beginner"
  },
  time_on_page: 120, // seconds
  current_section: "Learning Objectives"
}
```

### **Enhanced AI Prompts:**
```python
# Backend creates intelligent prompts like:
"""
