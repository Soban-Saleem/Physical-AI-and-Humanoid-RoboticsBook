# Welcome to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

<div className="physical-ai-hero">
  <h1>🤖 Bridge Digital AI to Physical Robotics</h1>
  <p>Master the future of AI - from digital brains to physical bodies</p>
</div>

## 🎯 Course Overview

Welcome to **Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics** - a comprehensive course that bridges the gap between digital AI and physical robotics. This course will take you on a journey from understanding AI concepts to controlling humanoid robots in simulated and real-world environments.

### What is Physical AI?

**Physical AI** represents the next evolution of artificial intelligence - AI systems that don't just think, but also act in the physical world. Unlike traditional AI confined to digital spaces, Physical AI:

- **Understands physical laws** (gravity, friction, momentum)
- **Operates in 3D space** with real-world constraints
- **Interacts with objects** through manipulation and navigation
- **Adapts to dynamic environments** with uncertainty

### Why Humanoid Robotics?

Humanoid robots are uniquely positioned to excel in our human-centered world because:

- 🏠 **Human environments** are designed for human form factors
- 📚 **Abundant training data** from human interactions and demonstrations
- 🤝 **Natural interaction** with humans through familiar body language
- 🔄 **Transferable skills** between virtual and real-world applications
