# Project Constitution

**Project**: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook  
**Version**: 1.0.0  
**Ratification Date**: 2024-12-02  
**Last Amended**: 2024-12-02

## Purpose

This project delivers a comprehensive, interactive textbook for teaching Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics, designed as a hackathon submission that meets all requirements while establishing a foundation for educational excellence in embodied intelligence.

## Core Principles

### 1. Hackathon Excellence
**Rule**: MUST achieve 100% of base requirements (100 points) plus ALL bonus features (200+ points) for maximum scoring.
**Rationale**: Competition submission requiring demonstration of technical excellence across AI/Spec-driven development, RAG chatbot, Better Auth, personalization, and Urdu translation.

### 2. Educational Innovation  
**Rule**: Content MUST be technically accurate, pedagogically sound, and demonstrate real-world Physical AI applications.
**Rationale**: This textbook will be used by students learning cutting-edge robotics and embodied intelligence concepts.

### 3. AI-First Integration
**Rule**: ALL AI features (RAG chatbot, content personalization, translation) MUST be functional with real user value.
**Rationale**: Core to hackathon scoring and demonstrates practical AI application in education.

### 4. Spec-Driven Excellence
**Rule**: Development MUST follow Spec-Kit Plus methodology with proper documentation, planning, and Claude Code integration.
**Rationale**: Explicitly required by hackathon specifications and ensures professional development practices.

### 5. User-Centric Experience
**Rule**: Features MUST prioritize accessibility, personalized learning paths, and multilingual support.
**Rationale**: Educational tools must adapt to diverse learning needs and demonstrate inclusive design.

### 6. Technical Robustness
**Rule**: All systems MUST be production-ready with proper error handling, security, and performance optimization.
**Rationale**: Hackathon judges will evaluate technical implementation quality and real-world viability.

## Governance

### Amendment Process
Constitution changes require:
1. Clear rationale aligned with hackathon goals
2. Version increment following semantic versioning  
3. Update of all dependent templates and documentation
4. Validation against hackathon requirements

### Versioning Policy
- MAJOR (x.0.0): Fundamental principle changes affecting hackathon strategy
- MINOR (x.y.0): New principles supporting additional features
- PATCH (x.y.z): Clarifications and refinements

### Compliance Review
All implementations MUST align with these principles and hackathon requirements before submission.
